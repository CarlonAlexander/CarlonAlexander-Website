        <p class="lead mb-4">My names is Carlon Alexander, I am eighteen years old, and I’m from Los Angeles California.  As a minority, I am a strong believer in giving back to my community whether it be picking up trash around my community and in my school, helping organize events at my local park, or tutoring young scholars that need help with their academics.  While in high school I played Varsity Basketball at my school and received high honors in the sport for my outstanding achievement.  Almost twice a year, with the motivation of my uncle who was an owner of a motorcycle club that advocated in peace, I would volunteer and hand out food to those in need in the Downtown Skid-Row area.  My personal reasoning for helping homeless victims is because I would hope that if I was homeless, someone would have the courage to help me out, whether it be making my day with a joke, lend me some change, or provide me with food.  I also like to give back to my community by volunteering at my father's job. My dad works as a manager at a Food Bank which he collects and distributes food to hunger-relief charities. My role as a volunteer is to make lunch packs, in which I made a package consisting of a sandwich with nutrients like fruits and vegetables as a supplement.  The satisfaction I get from feeding the homeless is the same I received from volunteering at a Food Bank. 
        <br><br>
With respect to my work experience, I’ve spent a summer working at In-N-Out burger.  While at at In-N-Out I learned valuable skills such as social skills, responsibility, and teamwork.  Although In-N-Out may just seem like a simple burger joint to work at its really not and is actually a very busy job and as far a first job goes, In-N-Out does a great job preparing you.  After spending a summer at In-N-Out I spent the following summer as a real estate intern for Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation agencies. While at Metro I felt that although I was in a new work environment, the same principles I learned while at In-N-Out still applied.  I still had to be responsible and on time to work everyday, I still had to work hard and fast everyday, and I still had to be a professional everyday.  Metro however provided me with an experience also priceless like the experience I received at In-N-Out.  Working Metro was a corporate job so for the first time ever, I had to arrive to work everyday in business attire which at first felt very uncomfortable, but then I got used to it and even begun to embrace it.  I’m currently not working now.  I’m focusing on my studies at the University of California Riverside and I’m currently attending the school as an undergraduate freshman planning to graduate in the year 2023.  Before attending the University of California Riverside I thought of studying business but with more consideration I plan to declare majoring in psychology as a sophomore.<br><br>
